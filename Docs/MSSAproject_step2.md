# Customer needs statement

		Hi, Sam's Software, i am an individual that needs a software built for an issue that plagues many people, both men and women across the world.
	Even with all this technology, information and social connections, making some decisions is still something that humans must do, such as, "What do i want to eat."
	Sure, you can look at recipies online, and ask a friend on social media, but i want an application that does it all for me.
	
	## I want 3 important features
	
	1. I want this program to have stored values of food ideas, ones that can be accesses whether i have Internet connection or not.
		There should be three distinct sections from this feature
			1. Breakfast
			2. Lunch
			3. Dinner
		These catagories will be input by the user, i would like it to maybe be a button the can click or tap.
		Once user input has been givenn it will move to section "2".
		
	2. Here in this section a plain text food idea should be presented. This should also be accessable offline. An example would be if "Breakfast" is chosen, the output from this section would be "French Toast"
	   Eventually i would like to have an option to expand on the complexity of the breakfast idea, given user defined parameters such as, how much time they have, and if cooking is possible.
	   
	   Lunch Example- Turkey Sandwhich
	   Dinner Example- Lasagna
	   
	3. The final feature i would like to see is connectivity to a recipe database, asking the user if they want to see a recipe, and then searching one or multiple websites or databases for a match,
	or maybe multiple matches the user can pick from.
	
	## Other future ideas
	1. Filter out foods
		1. Allergy Filters: Filter out keywords with "Peanut" or "soy" or "shellfish" - This may be able to turn into an initial User profile, what they like and 
		2. Vegetarian Filters
		3. Ethnicity of food Filter: "Mexican" or "Chinese"
		
	2. Link restraunt reccomendations for food type. 
	3. A weekly food generator for Meal Preppers that has a different set of variables and building algorythems.
